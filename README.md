Instagram Challenge
===================

## Instructions

* Challenge time: one weekend
* Feel free to use Google, your notes, books, etc., but work on your own
* If you refer to the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README
* If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution**
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning

## Task

Build Instagram: Simple huh!

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

Bonus if you can add filters!

## How to start

1. Produce some stories, break them down into tasks, and estimate
2. Fork this repo, clone, etc
3. Initialize a new rails project

Remember to proceed in small steps! Getting confused? Make the steps even smaller.

## Technologies used (plan)

* Node.js
* Express
* MongoDB, mongoose
* Cypress for testing
* React

## CRC Cards

| Collection | Keys |
|-----|-----|
| Users | username |
| | email |
| | password |
| Pictures | user_id|
| Comments | user_id|
|| content|

## My approach
1. Initialised project with Node, Express, Cypress
2. Created 1st test
3. Set up express server
4. Set up main, posts and signup routes, public folder, and passed tests for these. Added nodemon.



## Code Quality

For linting, you can use the `.rubocop.yml` in this repository (or your own!).
You'll need these gems:

```ruby
gem "rubocop", "0.79.0", require: false
gem "rubocop-rails"
```

You can also lint Javascript, CSS, and ERB — feel free to research this. These
will help you to train yourself to produce cleaner code — and will often alert
you to mistakes or mishaps!
